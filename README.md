This is a team project currently in progress created to analyze the correlation of NBA player's performance on their salary and overall appeal to coaches of teams scouting for new players. As this is a work in progress, updates are being made on a regular basis.  

# Introduction
Ever since professional baseball has gravitated towards data analytics for better decision making, the National Basketball Association (NBA) soon followed. The use of cameras now record every movement of both the ball and all 10 players 25 times per-second (Merrimack College, 2020). NBA analytics has made quite a contribution to the sport, and we will provide a few examples. NBA analytics plays a key role in selecting new players during the NBA draft, where teams sort through data on player description and performance metrics in hope of finding great talent. If a professional team makes the wrong player selection, it could set progress back by several years.

Scoring is another area affected by NBA analytics, where each individual player's free throw percentage and field goal locations are all closely analyzed in order to improve shooting form. Finally, NBA analytics plays a large role in assessing player matchups. By analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of their players and opponents, teams can strategize to place their players in favorable matchups. Our group will delve into this new and exciting field of analytics by performing various multivariate procedures on a dataset of NBA player performance metrics.
